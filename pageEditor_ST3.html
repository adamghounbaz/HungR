    <h3>I Was Involved In Making The Following Web Pages:</h3>

    <!--A link to the user profile page and a paragraph explaining what it is and how it works-->
    <div id="profile">
        <a href="profile.html"><h4>User Profile:</h4></a>

        <p>The user profile web page allows users to create an account with all their information such as qualifications, address and more. Users will be able to see all the information they have inputted during the account creation and at the very end, they will also be able to edit their inputs. There is a progress bar that dynamically updates as the user fills out their information.</p>
        <p>I have used a lot of java script throughout the website to save user's answers and dynamically output them to the user as they create their account. I have also used css to style the website and the progress bar.</p>
    </div>

    <!--A link to the team page and a paragraph explaining what it is and how it works-->
    <div id="team">
        <a href="team.html"><h4>Team Page:</h4></a>

        <p>The team page includes pictures of all members of the team that designed this website. It includes their names and when the cursor is hovered over the images, the team member's role in the website's production and what webpages they've designed is shown.</p>
        <p>I've used css throughout the website in order to style it and create feedback to the user when their cursor is hovered over an image. I also used css to display more information of the team member that the cursor is hovered over to the user.</p>
    </div>

    <!--A link to the content page and a paragraph explaining what it is and how it works-->
    <div id="content">
        <a href="content_ST3.html"><h4>Content Page (Ending World Hunger):</h4></a>

        <p>The content page includes various images and paragraphs explaining how our organization will help to end world hunger. There are various links in the webpage that allows users to quickly scroll to different subheadings</p>
        <p>Css has been used throughout the webpage to both style and resize the images and to create a navbar to allow users to easily skip to different subheadings by making the nav bar permanently fixed on the top of the screen.</p>
